            <p>According to <span class="book">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</span>
            by Douglas Adams, the Answer to life, the universe, and everything is 42.
            Many people look for meaning in the number 42, and although there are many 
            interesting things that can be said about it, Douglas Adams said that he only
            chose it because it sounds funny</p>
